# Power of Zustand + React Query

Welcome to the **Power of Zustand + React Query** project! In this project, we explore the combined capabilities of React, Typescript, Vite, Zustand, and React Query to create efficient and powerful web applications.

## Tools Used

- **React:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Typescript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language, providing better tooling and preventing common programming errors.
- **Vite:** A fast, modern build tool for frontend development. It provides instant server start and optimized builds.
- **Zustand:** A small, fast, and scaleable state management library for React applications.
- **React Query:** A data-fetching and state management library for React applications. It provides a powerful and flexible way to manage data fetching and state synchronization in your components.
